** Instantiating New Threads

        * First way
        public class MyThread extends Thread {

            private final int mSeed;

            public MyThread (int seed){
               mSeed = seed;
            }

            @Override
            public void run(){
               // perform some calculation
            }
        }

        Thread thread = new MyThread(10);
        thread.start();

        ------------------
        * Second way
        Runnable runnable = new Runnable (){
           @Override
           public void run (){
               int seed = 10;
               // perform some calculation
           }
        }

        Thread thread = new Thread (runnable)
        thread.start();
