** Instantiating New Threads

        * First way
        public class MyThread extends Thread {

            private final int mSeed;

            public MyThread (int seed){
               mSeed = seed;
            }

            @Override
            public void run(){
               // perform some calculation
            }
        }

        Thread thread = new MyThread(10);
        thread.start();

        ------------------
        * Second way
        Runnable runnable = new Runnable (){
           @Override
           public void run (){
               int seed = 10;
               // perform some calculation
           }
        }

        Thread thread = new Thread (runnable)
        thread.start();


** Important roots in android application (Memory leak)

   1. Objects referenced from static fields
   2. Instances of Application class
   3. Live threads

   Anonymous Threads
   if you use a Thread with no name like this

      class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {
          onCreate(){
             new Thread(new Runnable()) {
                @Override
                public void run(){

                }
             }.start();
          }
      }

   this causes memory leak in MainActivity.
